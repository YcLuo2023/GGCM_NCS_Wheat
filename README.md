# GGCM_NCS_Wheat

This repository will deposit the code as follows:

## Novel framework to improve crop model skills in assessing extreme weather impacts on global crop productivity
(1) a New Calibration Scheme for genetic parameters developed for the Global Gridded Crop Model (version name: GGCM-NCS);
(2) The automatic parameterization strategy of ECOtype-specific parameters (version name: GGCM-NCS-ECO);
(3) Incorporation of a series of Wang-Engel temperature response functions into GGCM-NCS-ECO (version name: GGCM-NCS-ECO-WE);

Automatic parameter calibration was conducted based on the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm, which was performed using R version 4.3.1. Automatic generation of input files, such as weather (.WTH), soil (.SOL), cultivar (.CUL and .ECO), and experiment (.WHX) were performed using Matlab R2022b.
